`cargo-compiler-interrupts` provides you a seamless way to integrate the
[Compiler Interrupts][compiler-interrupts-paper] to any Rust packages.
Check out the Compiler Interrupts [main repository][compiler-interrupts] for more info.

## Requirements

* [Rust 1.45.0][rust] or later and [LLVM 9][llvm] or later are required.
Both must have the same LLVM version.
* You can check the LLVM version from Rust toolchain and LLVM toolchain by running `rustc -vV`
and `llvm-config --version` respectively.
* x86-64 architecture with Linux or macOS is highly recommended.
Other architectures and platforms have not been tested.

## Installation

`cargo-compiler-interrupts` can be installed via `cargo install`.

``` sh
cargo install cargo-compiler-interrupts
```

You can also fetch the repo and install  using `--path`.

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/bitslab/cargo-compiler-interrupts
cargo install --path ./cargo-compiler-interrupts
```

## Getting started

`cargo-compiler-interrupts` provides three subcommands:

``` sh
cargo lib-ci --install    # install the CI library
cargo build-ci            # build and integrate CI to the binary
cargo run-ci              # run the CI-integrated binary
```

* `cargo lib-ci` — manage the Compiler Interrupts library.
* `cargo build-ci` — build and integrate the Compiler Interrupts to the package.
* `cargo run-ci` — run the integrated binary.
You can specify which binary to run by passing `--bin <BINARY>`.

Run `cargo lib-ci --install` to install the Compiler Interrupts library first.
Before running `cargo build-ci`, add the Compiler Interrupts API package as the dependency for
your Cargo package and registers the Compiler Interrupts handler in your program.
Compiler Interrupts API is provided through the [`compiler-interrupts`][compiler-interrupts-rs]
package.

``` rust
fn interrupt_handler(ic: i64) {
    println!("Compiler interrupt called with instruction count: {}", ic);
}

unsafe {
    compiler_interrupts::register(1000, 1000, interrupt_handler);
}
```

For more detailed usages and internals, run the command with `--help` option and
check out the **[documentation]**.

## Contribution

All issue reports, feature requests, pull requests and GitHub stars are welcomed
and much appreciated. Issues relating to the Compiler Interrupts library
